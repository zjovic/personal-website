      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Over the last 10 years of my professional career, I've acquired a very wide skillset; from design and customer support to project management. But, for the last 2 years, I've been focusing on my true passion...</p>
      <p>I've always been drawn to the overlap between design and development. I enjoy each aspect and love building sites & mobile apps from start to finish for clients all over the world.</p>
      <p>While I might not have many years of experience in frontend development, I believe my experience from different aspects of product lifecycle gives me a much wider and clearer picture of the product that I'm working on.</p>
      <p>I'm available for work - if you would like to build something together, please, get in touch @ zvonimir.jovic.ri@gmail.com</p>
